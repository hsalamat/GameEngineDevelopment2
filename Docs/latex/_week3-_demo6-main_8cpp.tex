\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Scene Node -\/ sprite Node. 

Each scene node can store an object that is drawn on the screen, most often this is an entity. Each node may have an arbitrary amount of child nodes, which adapt to the transform of their parent node when rendering. Children only store the position, rotation, and scale relative to their parent. \mbox{\hyperlink{class_a}{A}} scene graph contains a root scene node, which exists only once in a world. It resides above all other scene nodes in the hierarchy, thus it has no parent node.
